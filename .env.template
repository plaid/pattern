# Only required for OAuth:

# Sandbox Mode:
# Set the PLAID_SANDBOX_REDIRECT_URI below to 'http://localhost:3001/oauth-link'.
# The OAuth redirect flow requires an endpoint on the developer's website
# that the bank website should redirect to. You will also need to configure
# this redirect URI for your client ID through the Plaid developer dashboard
# at https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api.
# Development mode:
# When running in development mode, you must use an https:// url.
# You will need to configure this https:// redirect URI in the Plaid developer dashboard.
# If your system is not set up to run localhost with https://, you will be unable to test
# the OAuth in development and should leave the PLAID_DEVELOPMENT_REDIRECT_URI blank.
