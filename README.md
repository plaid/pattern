# Plaid Pattern

![Plaid Pattern client][client-img]

This is a reference application demonstrating an end-to-end [Plaid][plaid] integration, focused on linking items and fetching transaction data.

**This is not meant to be run as a production application.**

## Requirements

-   [Docker][docker] Version 2.0.0.3 (31259) or higher, installed, running, and signed in. If you're on **Windows**, check out [this link][wsl] to get set up in WSL.
-   [Plaid API keys][plaid-keys] - [sign up][plaid-signup] for a free Sandbox account if you don't already have one

## Getting Started

Note: We recommend running these commands in a unix terminal. Windows users can use a [WSL][wsl] terminal to access libraries like `make`.

1. Clone the repo.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/plaid/pattern.git
    cd pattern
    ```
1. Create the `.env` file.
    ```shell
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
1. Update the `.env` file with your [Plaid API keys][plaid-keys].
1. Configure the Oauth redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/oauth-link` on your [dashboard][plaid-dashboard].
1. Start the services. The first run may take a few minutes as Docker images are pulled/built for the first time.
    ```shell
    make start
    ```
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.
1. When you're finished, stop the services.
    ```shell
    make stop
    ```

## Additional Commands

All available commands can be seen by calling `make help`.

## Architecture

As a modern full-stack application, Pattern consists of multiple services handling different segments of the stack:

-   [`database`][database-readme] runs a [PostgreSQL][postgres] database
-   [`server`][server-readme] runs an application back-end server using [NodeJS] and [Express]
-   [`client`][client-readme] runs a [React]-based single-page web frontend
-   [`ngrok`][ngrok-readme] exposes a [ngrok] tunnel from your local machine to the Internet to receive webhooks

We use [Docker Compose][docker-compose] to orchestrate these services. As such, each individual service has its own Dockerfile, which Docker Compose reads when bringing up the services.

For more information about the individual services, see their readmes, linked in the list above.

## Troubleshooting

See [`docs/troubleshooting.md`][troubleshooting].
